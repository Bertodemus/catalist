## A small web application that allows you to create a cat!
With Cat-A-List, you can select various options for your cats appearance and then save it... to a list... because that's fun.

### What is actually going on here?
This is a small practice app that is inteded to keep me coding, practicing, and problem solving. I hope to cover everything from front end to back-end with this little app. I will also make room for permanent storage and possibly include user creation/auth.

### Current Tech Stack:
- React + TypeScript + Vite - Front End
- MobX - State Management
- Nest JS - Back-End
- Postgres - Permanent Storage
- Supabase (or possibly pocketbase or Appwrite) - Hosting / Auth
